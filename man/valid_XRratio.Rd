\description{
\code{valid_XRratio()} calculates the exchange rate ratio (XR-ratio), which is a region/country's XR-price
for a product divided by the geometric mean of the product price.
Variability can be compared to highlight products in countries/regions
that are most variable (high XR-ratio) across countries.
